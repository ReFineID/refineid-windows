//! Authors the Windows Installer package for the Card Module.
//!
//! An MSI is a relational database in a compound file, and Windows ships the
//! API that writes one. This crate uses that API directly, so building the
//! installer needs nothing beyond Windows itself and `makecab.exe`.
//!
//! The package this describes is deliberately small: one system DLL, the
//! registry values that bind it to a card, and a service restart. It
//! installs no application, service, shortcut, or custom action, because a
//! driver package that can only copy a file and write registry values has a
//! correspondingly small failure surface.
