//! Structured event infrastructure.
//!
//! Library and binary crates emit observable events through this
//! module. Events are typed Rust structs that implement the
//! [`EventRecord`] trait; sinks are runtime-configurable
//! implementations of [`LogSink`]. The wire form is flat-key-
//! value JSON Lines per `doc/observability.md`.
//!
//! The full architectural reasoning -- deployment profiles
//! (personal / enterprise / air-gap), severity contract, three-
//! tier persistence, privacy classification, network-by-
//! instruction rules -- lives in `doc/observability.md` and
//! `doc/security/excellence-rules.md` (Rules E15 through E21).
//! This module is the implementation foundation those documents
//! describe.
//!
//! ## What this module provides today
//!
//! - The [`EventRecord`] trait: every event type's compile-time
//!   API. Hardcodes its [`EventName`], [`Severity`],
//!   [`Persistence`], and the typed-field iteration.
//! - Validated identifier newtypes: [`EventName`] and
//!   [`FieldName`] with `const fn` constructors that reject
//!   malformed input at compile time.
//! - Enum primitives: [`Severity`] (eight RFC 5424 levels per
//!   Rule E16), [`Persistence`] (three tiers per Rule E18),
//!   [`FieldPrivacy`] and [`FieldDescriptor`] (per-field
//!   privacy classification per Rule E1's privacy model).
//! - The [`LogSink`] trait + the [`StderrSink`] implementation
//!   that writes the canonical JSON Lines wire form.
//! - The global emission mechanism: [`set_global_sink`] and
//!   [`emit`]. The shape matches `log::set_logger` /
//!   `tracing::set_global_default`: first-write-wins, no-op
//!   when unset (with a one-time stderr notice on first emit
//!   into a no-sink state).
//!
//! ## What this module does NOT provide yet
//!
//! - Per-platform sinks (`os_log`, `journald`, `eventlog`).
//! - Remote sinks (`syslog` over TLS, OTLP). The personal-
//!   profile build deliberately excludes these (Rule E17);
//!   the enterprise-profile feature gate is future work.
//! - The `no_network` Cargo feature for air-gap builds.
//! - The `refineid-events-derive` proc-macro. Manual `impl
//!   EventRecord` for now; add the macro when event count
//!   grows past ~30 per the Open follow-ups in
//!   `doc/observability.md`.
//!
//! Each follow-up has a matching entry in observability.md's
//! Open follow-ups section.
